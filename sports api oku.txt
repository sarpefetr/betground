Getting Started
1. Get an API Key
Head over to our pricing page and sign up for a free account here. You’ll receive an API key that will grant you access to the API.

After creating an account you will receive an email with your API key. You will then use this key to authenticate your requests to the API.

2. Make Your First Request
Now that you have your API key, you can start making requests to the Sports Game Odds API. You’ll want to add your API key into the ‘X-API-Key’ header for each request you make.

Manually - With a Browser Extension
You can use a browser extension like Postman Interceptor or Restlet Client to manually send requests to the API.

Install the extension.
Open the extension and create a new request.
Set the request type to GET.
Enter the API endpoint URL, e.g., https://api.sportsgameodds.com/v2/sports/.
Add a new header with the key X-API-Key and the value as your API key.
Send the request and view the response.
Manually - With an App Like Postman
Postman is a powerful tool for testing and interacting with APIs.

Download and install Postman.
Open Postman and create a new request.
Set the request type to GET.
Enter the API endpoint URL, e.g., https://api.sportsgameodds.com/v2/sports/.
Go to the Headers tab and add a new header with the key X-API-Key and the value as your API key.
Click Send to make the request and view the response.
Manually - From the Reference Docs
You can also make requests directly from our API Reference page. Each endpoint has an interactive section where you can input your API key and parameters to see the response.

With Code

Javascript

Python

Ruby

PHP

Java

// This example uses fetch() but you can use any HTTP library
const requestOptions = {
    method: 'GET',
    headers: { 'X-Api-Key': 'YOUR_API_KEY' }
};
const requestUrl = 'https://api.sportsgameodds.com/v2/sports/'; 
fetch(requestUrl, requestOptions) 
  .then(response => response.json()) 
  .then(data => console.log(data))
  .catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));
Head over to our detailed API reference here to see all the available endpoints and parameters that the Sports Game Odds API has to offer.

API Reference


Getting Data in Batches
This following information only applies to the /teams, /events, and /odds endpoints.

Most endpoints will always return all results which match your query. However, since the /teams, /events, and /odds endpoints can potentially return hundreds or even thousands of results, the resulting objects are paginated/limited and must be fetched in batches.

The number of items by each request to these endpoints is determined by the limit parameter. This parameter currently has a default value of 10 but can be overridden up to a max value of 100.

In some cases you may want to fetch all of the results from these endpoints. To do this, you can feed the nextCursor in the resonse as the cursor parameter in your next request to pick up where you left off. When the response does not contain a nextCursor property, you have reached the end of the results.

Let’s take the following example, where we want to grab all finalized NBA events:


Javascript

Python

Ruby

PHP

java

$next_cursor = null;
$event_data = [];

do {
    $ch = curl_init();
    $url = "https://api.sportsgameodds.com/v2/events?leagueID=NBA&marketOddsAvailable=true&limit=50&cursor=" . urlencode($next_cursor);

    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, 1);
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL, $url);

    $response = curl_exec($ch);
    curl_close($ch);

    $data = json_decode($response, true);
    $event_data = array_merge($event_data, $data['events']);

    $next_cursor = $data['nextCursor'];

} while ($next_cursor);

foreach ($event_data as $event) {
    $odds = $event['odds'];
    foreach ($odds as $odd_id => $odd_object) {
        echo "Odd ID: " . $odd_id . "\n";
        echo "Odd Value: " . $odd_object['closeOdds'] . "\n";
    }
}
